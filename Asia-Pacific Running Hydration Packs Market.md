Primarily, these applications are divided into competitive sports and leisure activities. The competitive sports segment is marked by an increasing number of elite athletes and sports enthusiasts who rely on advanced hydration solutions during rigorous training and events. These hydration packs are tailored for performance, offering features such as lightweight materials, high capacity, and ergonomic designs that help athletes stay hydrated without compromising their agility. Competitive runners, in particular, benefit from these packs as they provide a hands-free drinking solution, allowing them to maintain optimal hydration levels over long distances or during strenuous activities without the need for frequent stops.The leisure segment, on the other hand, caters to non-professional athletes and recreational enthusiasts who engage in outdoor running, hiking, and other fitness-related activities for health and enjoyment rather than competition. These users typically prioritize comfort and convenience, looking for hydration packs that are easy to use, comfortable to carry, and well-suited to their outdoor adventures.
