In addition to sustainability, individual mobility consulting also focuses on enhancing the overall user experience. Services are offered to help individuals optimize their daily commuting, whether through planning the most efficient routes, suggesting alternative modes of transportation, or recommending the best vehicles for specific needs. This segment is particularly significant in urban areas, where the need for personalized mobility solutions is heightened due to traffic congestion, limited parking, and increasing demand for shared transportation services.
